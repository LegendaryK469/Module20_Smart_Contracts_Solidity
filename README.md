# Module20_Smart_Contracts_Solidity
This project aims to automate the creation of joint savings accounts by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
